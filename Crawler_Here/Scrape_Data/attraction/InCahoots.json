            "Nơi này thực sự có thể cần trang điểm. Nó dường như đang chạy xuống. Nếu bạn có thể vượt qua điều đó, thì những người đấu thầu quán bar và người hướng dẫn khiêu vũ thực sự rất thân thiện. Nó bắt đầu với một đám đông lớn tuổi hơn và đến 10 tuổi thì độ tuổi trung bình là 20. Mọi người đều thân thiện. Bạn phải trả một vài đô la để vào và đồ uống là 2. Tôi không khuyên bạn nên đến quán ăn nhanh ở đó. Đi chơi và vui chơi.Đọc thêm",
            "I have been coming here for a good time for over 10 years.  I have been to around a dozen country music bardance clubs in southern California over the years.  InCahoots is by far the best!  I was introduced to line dancing and country music at Midnight Rodeo in 1996.  Because I did not have to worry about being roughed up by gangster types like at most of the bars, I started going regularly to country music barsdance clubs weekly.  It seemed like a lost cause though because Midnight Rodeo was over an hours drive away and all the other bars I visit seem to go under in a few months or years.  In 2002 I found out about InCahoots and have been coming here religiously every Friday ever since.  The cover charges for Fridays and Tuesdays are:  free before 7pm and 5 after 7pm.  On Wednesday night:  if you are over 21, then you pay 5 cover charge; if you are 18-20, then you pay 12 cover charge since InCahoots cannot make any money on alcohol from minors.Whats so great about this club?  As I mentioned previously, I feel safe here;  I dont need to worry about accidentally bumping into someone or being perceived as looking at someone the wrong way.  The people are friendly, including both the people that work here as well as the customers.  Some of the regular customers I see every week and have been invited to their parties.  People bring you a slice of cake when there is a birthday.  Others try to find you a seat.  Also InCahoots plays great music you can dance to:  by yourself with line dances or with a partner during couple dances.  At 7:30pm and 8:30pm, the dance instructor Terena will teach a couple dance and a line dance lesson, respectively.Most nights, there is a DJ, but on some nights live bands come in to play.  Tuesday and Friday are 21 and over, and Wednesday is college night 18 and over.  They are doing so well that they get over 900 customers on some Wednesday nights and are trying to expand the 18 and over night to Sunday also.  About once a month, they bring in the mechanical bull for you to ride for free.  Every night, you can go up and request songs or dances.  Besides dancing, there are several other reasons to visit. InCahoots runs drink specials, and occasionally Jack Daniels girls or Bud Light girls come to visit.  Shawn Parr from Go Country 105 visits frequently about once a month and gives out free things like concert tickets.  In fact, Shawn Parr just celebrated his birthday party there last night!  They have karaoke out on the patio some nights.  There is also a restaurant on the premises: the buffalo wings, chicken quesadillas, and tacos are delicious.In addition to all the regular customers, some people come here to celebrate their bachelorbachelorette parties, birthday parties, graduation parties.  My wife already told me to plan her 40th birthday party here in a few years.  I highly recommend you check out this nightclub, especially if you like country music!Read more"
