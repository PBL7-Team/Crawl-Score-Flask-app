            "First we really enjoyed this reserve.  Gorgeous and full of wildlife, and I highly recommend coming here!\n\nI am dealing with cancer treatments and have varied tolerance for walking  - 1-3 miles typically -   and we asked the lady at the discovery center how long the paths were, and she told me about a mile.    THIS IS INCORRECT\n\nIn fact it is about 2.5 miles to take the popular alligator alley trail and then come back up the shortcut to the visitor - s center and there are very few benches, and mid day, very little shade.  \n\nThe map is correct- if you actually look at it, but alligator alley  - 1.2 mi -  is just part of the trail.  To get to it, you have to take the shady oak trail  - .7 mi -  and to get back to the center you have to take Heron Hideout trail  - .3 mi - .   AND on the map, a trail that follows the Shady Oak trail is FUCHSIA which looks nearly red and is easily confused to be a different part of the Alligator alley trail.  \n\nThis was a  - 1.5 mile day -  for my tolerance and I was really struggling, looking eagerly for the cut back up to the visitors center for a long while.     \n\nI hope this helps others wanting this experience.  There is no shortcut for alligator alley from what I saw.  \n\nOne option I see is to take Heron Hideout trail from the center and go as far as you want as it meets up with Alligator alley, turn around and head back for a loop instead of the circle that is 2.2 miles.Read more",

            "Wow! This place is amazing! I - m not from Florida so had never been to a place like this before. My brother and his wife took us here recently because we all enjoying walking trails and they thought we - d enjoy seeing all of the interesting birds here. They warned us there is a path referred to as  - Alligator Alley -  but I was really excited to check it out! \n\nAs we walked, we did see, and were amazed by, a wide variety of beautiful birds - like White Ibis, Great Blue Herons, and Great Egrets. But we all stood in awe as a regal Bald Eagle flew overhead! And as we gazed out into Lake Hancock, which the trail ran along, we started seeing more and more alligators lurking about. \n\nAt one point the trail narrowed and was sandwiched between the lake on one side and a marsh on the other. It truly felt like we were experiencing something pre-historic! And yes, we were about to enter Alligator Alley! Gators are known to cross this path and if they decide to hang out in the middle, trail walkers must wait until the gators are ready to move along. It was really exciting to come across a gator  - looking very well-fed -  doing just that! We could see a couple ladies a ways back on the other side of this guy that had been waiting 15 minutes. But luckily we only had to wait a couple minutes before he decided to leave. \n\nParking is free and so is access to the paths. I would love to come back here again!Read more",
            "Our tram tour of the Circle B Bar Reserve was very peaceful and informative.  Eric, our guide was a former educator and made the hour plus ride go by quickly.  He told us how the area was a cattle ranch in the past and in the year 2000, it was purchased to restore the main wetland now known as Banana Creek Marsh.  The restoration project is ongoing.  All the changes create new food sources and habitats for thousands of wildlife and migrating birds.  On our adventure ride, we saw a Great Blue Heron, Anhinga, White Ibis and a Bald Eagle.   We even saw a glimpse of few alligators lurking in the beautiful, clear blue water.  The reserve also has The Polk Nature Discovery Center, which provides information about Polk County - s natural resources and water.  They also have monthly activities and nature workshops there.  If you just want to hike the trails, you have a choice of Alligator Alley, Eagle Roast, Heron Hideout, Lost Bridge, Marsh Rabbit Run, Shady Oak, Wading Bird Way, Windmill Whistle and Treefrog Trail.  It was an awesome way to spend the day, exploring all the nature that this former ranch has to offer.Read more",

            "Siêu đi lang thang.  Nhiều loài động vật hoang dã - cá sấu - Alligator Alley thật tuyệt vời -, các loài chim, các sinh vật nhỏ cũng vậy.  Bản thân tán rừng đã đẹp vô cùng.  Lưu ý: cá sấu thích phơi nắng trên đường mòn khi nhiệt độ dưới 88 hoặc 90 độ F - hoặc chúng tôi đã được thông báo ở một khu vực khác - và điều đó dường như đúng - .  Chúng tôi đã đi vào lúc 1 giờ chiều vào một ngày nắng nóng và họ ở trong hồ rất đẹp nên chúng tôi không cần phải quay lại.

            "I have been to this reserve twice - once in March 2018 and once in March 2020. During the first trip, between the lake and Heron Way, I saw an overabundance of wading and other birds from Osprey to various Herons to Roseate Spoonbills to Ibis and more. On Heron way a pair of Sandhill Cranes walked down the path with their little chick in tow. It was amazing.\nDuring my most recent trip however, there were very few birds in comparison but the number of Alligators was far greater. I saw two or three on my first visit but on the last trip they were everywhere. The lake looked like an armada of alligators and they were in the marshes on Heron Way as well. Has the Alligator population there increased that dramatically and has it discouraged the birds from using the reserve to feed? The Alligators have their appeal but in limited numbers. I would hate to see those wonderful birds abandon such a beautiful place because there were too many predators. Any knowledgeable responses are appreciated.Read more",
            "As a snow bird, we have visited for about 10 years.   I also agree that the wildlife changes daily, but as we talk with locals from the area, they are also concerned about the lack of large flocks of birds.   But,   that seems to be happening all over Florida.   We visit 4 reserves constantly when we are in Florida and they all have had a shift for fewer birds. Having said that, it seems to be the luck of the draw if you are looking for a particular bird.  So frustrating when you know the bird was seen one day, , and the next it does not appear. . Oh, to be able to fly and land where you want to. As amateur  photographers we often are up at 4:00 am to get to locations for the first light, , but many times we have been amazed that a particular bird flys in at 1:00 pm. . . So if you are not a morning person, , you may still see that special bird you are looking for, , but you will have to fight the heat. . remember at Circle b Bar there was a lot of damage from the Hurricane several years ago, , we forget that the a Hurricane upsets a lot of habitats including, , HOW do all these little birds survive, or do they, including the larger birds???  It took Circle B Bar years to clean up from that Hurricane.     We really enjoy Circle B Bar.  I also want to add a comment that the Alligators are really just part of Florida and they too have behaviors that are interesting to us viewers. .  Have you ever watched an Alligator eat another Alligator??  we have at Circle B Bar. . I won - t ever forget it. .   Enjoy all you see and keep the memories forever.Read more",
