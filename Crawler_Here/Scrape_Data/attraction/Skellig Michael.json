            "Sceilig Mhichíl is a stunningly beautiful place. From the scenery to the wildlife to the history it is a trip not to be missed. The guides on the island are excellent. \n\nThe steps are steep but definitely doable. 2½ hours is plenty of time to get up and down even with lots of breaks! \n\nI have to give a special mention to Brendan and David of The Force Awakens ferry that leaves from Ballinskelligs pier. They went out of their way to make sure we had an enjoyable day, taking us all the way around Sceilig Bheag on the way there and around the back of Sceilig Mhichíl on the way back, showing us all the little coves and pointing out interesting things in the landscape that I would not have noticed otherwise. They are very knowledgeable about the area and particularly the sea conditions - I felt I was in very safe hands with them. If you can get a spot on their boat, I would highly recommend doing that! Even enjoyed a coffee and the chats with Brendan in the local Cafe Cois Trá afterwards.Read more",
            "Skellig is incredible. We did the skellig landing tour. On arrival, we were told that the swell meant that we would not be able to land. The boat operators had emailed us earlier in the morning to say this was a strong possibility. \n\nThankfully, the decision was reversed and we left just after 10am. The boat was very small and the boat journey is stunning with beautiful views. We were taken around the little skellig and then landed on skellig michael. The journey was a little rough and I got sick. However landing on skellig this was forgotten.\nThe island is cool. There is quite a steep climb up to the top but it is well worth it. The views are incredible as is the monastery with its beehive huts.\nThe guides on the island give a safety briefing before going up the steps and a brief history of the island at the top.\nWe were brought around the back of the island to see the lighthouse on the boat journey back. \nI have wanted to go to skellig for years and it more than lived up to expectations particularly after the initial disappointment of it being cancelled and then uncancelled.  I can - t recommend this highly enough although I do think the boat journey is quite expensive. \nRead more",

            "We were so lucky that we were the first trip in a week to get to go to Skellig Michael. The force was definitely with us since I did not book an extra trip the next day in case ours was cancelled. We did our tour through Skellig Michael Boat trips and our boat was Lady Clare. The skies were cloudy when we left the dock and the water was a little rough on the way there. Several people on our boat were sick, so if you have a tendency for sea sickness, bring your sea bands  - the boat provides the buckets - . Once on the island, we had 2 and 1 - 2 hours to explore, which is plenty of time. Again the force was with us because the clouds parted and we saw the sun for the first time in days. You can climb the stairs at your own pace, so take your time. My daughter is afraid of heights so she bear crawled in some spots to keep her footing. When you get to the top of the steps where all of the beehive huts are located, there is a guide that gives the history of the island and the monks that lived there. You can walk inside the huts, so we took full advantage of getting some alone time while most of our tour mates were listening to the guide. I think there was only one other tour group on the island with ours, so it really is a nice intimate experience and you are able to get many clean photos. We had started heading down long before they told us our time was up. We used the free time to use the restrooms. When it was time to leave, they gave a quick view of the side of the island, showing us where the monks used to arrive before a dock was built. They also passed by Little Skellig and talked about the birds before we headed back. This was such an amazing experience and worth the money.Read more",

            "It - s one of those gems that take extra effort and patience... endurance... to fully appreciate - getting here on a rough hour boat ride is one thing, then climbing up the stairs  - I normally have fear of heights but did well, my wife no fear of heights struggled greatly, especially on the way down and had some vertigo issues -  - also add on top of this that your boat may be cancelled due to weather conditions or our tour cut by 1h due to weather conditions changing and people can  - burn -  themselves - but once you do get to experience and go through it you will remember and appreciate this amazing island for the rest of your life!If you love Puffins  - who doesnt -  there were absolutely tones of them, more even than we experienced in Iceland at the same time of the year in 2022 : -  There are different companies doing the tours - some have bigger better looking boats  - probably providing better comfort too -  than others so choose wisely - I have reviewed our experience separately with the company from Valentia Island if you are interested see the separate reviewTIP: bring some water and food with you - there are restrooms on the island nowadays but no vendors and considering the boat ride is about 1h each way and most tours leave you on the island for about 3h you got about 5h or more so small snack and something to drink is a must - especially after those stairs : -  also bring some layers with you, you do warm up going up and being exposed to the sun but it does get windy and also colder when the sun gets behind cloudsRead more",

            "Trong số tất cả những gì chúng tôi đã làm trong 11 ngày ở Ireland, Skellect Michael Landing Tour CHẮC CHẮN nằm trong Top 3. Toàn bộ trải nghiệm từ đi thuyền, đến hòn đảo phủ đầy chim, cho đến leo bậc thang lên tu viện, mọi thứ đều kỳ diệu. Chuyến đi lên các bậc thang, CÓ GIẢI PHÁP, có thể chỉ mất 25 phút nên hầu như tất cả các cấp độ thể chất đều có thể leo lên được. Những chiếc thuyền cho bạn RẤT NHIỀU thời gian để leo lên các bậc thang, dạo quanh và khám phá trên đỉnh rồi quay trở lại - vì vậy KHÔNG CẦN phải vội vàng. Mọi cấp độ kỹ năng đều có thể leo lên được, miễn là bạn không sợ độ cao. Rất khuyến khích các tour du lịch hạ cánh. MẸO - nhận được hướng dẫn rất rõ ràng về nơi gặp nhau. Có rất nhiều công ty chèo thuyền đến cùng một địa điểm và trong cùng một ngày nên việc bắt đầu hơi khó hiểu.Đọc thêm",
            "Chúng tôi đã có thể đặt chuyến tham quan hạ cánh ở chế độ phút cuối qua điện thoại với David - tất cả các lượt đặt chỗ nội tuyến với tất cả các nhà cung cấp khác đều đã đầy trong nhiều tuần... - . Một trải nghiệm tuyệt vời! David không chỉ rất tử tế mà anh ấy còn có thể chèo thuyền - với tư cách là chiếc thuyền duy nhất ngày hôm nay! - trong các vịnh nhỏ của Đảo Skellig số 1. Sau đó, bất chấp biển động, anh ấy cũng đưa chúng tôi đi một vòng quanh Skellect Michael trước khi lên bờ - ở đây một lần nữa chúng tôi không thấy chiếc thuyền nào khác làm điều đó - ...và cuối cùng chúng tôi có 2,5 giờ tại chỗ - nhiều hơn giá vé tiêu chuẩn là 2 giờ .Trở lại đất liền, người cha 75 tuổi của ông - người lái thuyền ! - mời chúng tôi đi uống cà phê ở quán Café gần đó và dành một thời gian dài để nói về cuộc sống của anh ấy ở đây...tuyệt vời.Đọc thêm",
