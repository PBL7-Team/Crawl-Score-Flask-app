            "I was moving to Da Nang for 3 months and wanted to finish my laser session so I reached out to multiple clinics and spas to inquire about the laser hair removal treatments. They were all very accommodating and were willing to do almost anything to have me come in. However, Pure Beauty Spa PBS was very direct- the first thing she asked was if I was traveling or living in the area.I told her that I will be moving to Da Nang, so she offered the package since it is overall cheaper but would sell per session if I wished to go that route.I proceed to share that I will only be in Da Nang for 3 months, so she responded with:So pay per session is better for you in this case. But to be honest, if you want a few sessions before or you will continue to do it after left Danang then come and do treatments at our spa. If not continue so please do not waste your money. Because it needs a few times to see results.Alternatively, you can try one time for experience.She proceeded to share the timeline so I may better understand that I can only do the treatment every 3 to 6 weeks.I loved her honesty and loved that even 4 months later, she has not pressured me or asked me when I wanted to make an appointment or when am I coming in. Rather, she just answers any random questions I asked a lot I have and tell her to simply let her know when I am ready.I thanked her for her honesty and patience, and she simply said that she only wants her clients to be satisfied with their services so she is not going to pressure anyone if they are not ready or choose to go elsewhere, and she is not going to trick them to get their money for a few sessions without receiving the results they want.That was what made me choose them. When entering the spa - it was bright, lit, and very chic. From a superficial standpoint, check!She had offered me water and confirmed on the services that I wanted she already knew it by heart because I contacted her so many times for the past 4 months. I then followed the technician to the room where the machine was. She was very detailed and checked to see where all my hairs were - reshaping them AND asking them to not shave it prior to coming in. Usually, I am asked to and read so. She stated that it may make it easier for the technicians but for them, they want to see how your hair is growing, where to focus on, etc. so they rather shave it for you so to come unshaven next time.The treatments were not painfulless painful than my last 3 sessions and they used numbing cream so many thanks for her shaving so well.Afterward, I was presented with tea to end my session. The staff was very sweet. I also asked for recommendations for food, groceries, knick-knacks, etc and the owner was very willing to recommend great affordable places!So thankful for them and would highly recommend it!I wish I did all my laser treatments here.Read more"
