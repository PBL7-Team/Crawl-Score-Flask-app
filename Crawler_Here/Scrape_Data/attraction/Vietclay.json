One afternoon in Saigon in August on a small alley on Tran Quoc Toan Street, District 3, I went to a small class to teach pottery as a healing therapy after life - s difficulties and confusions. I realized being in contact with the earth allowed me to connect more deeply with myself. I have time and space to separate reason and emotions to see things more tolerantly and objectively. I love pottery when it - s not good, whenever I feel stressed, I find a class to study. Thanks to that, I had the opportunity to meet very generous and kind artisans in Jakarta and Bat Trang. The brothers and sisters showed me the techniques of pottery, how to glaze, how to fire and most of all, enthusiasm for the profession. From my own experience, I opened a small ceramic studio to continue my love. The studio - s space is minimalist, making the most of ceramics, from the working table, the turntable to the kiln space... creating a small, light-filled ceramic workshop with full equipment to produce works of art. Unique art ceramic. Not only do I sell my own works, I also sell unique ceramics by other artists. In general, just because of the passion for collecting. I appreciate the deep, rustic, sentimental soil of the earth as well as the subtle floating that the painter shows on the pottery. The fun fact is that our pottery has a soul. Artists and brothers often listen to the Dharma when making pottery and believe that this will convey the best in their work. Since then, Vietclay has been created by feeling the love and care in each work and taking the time to immerse yourself in objects born of earth, water and fire. With appreciation for the simple, rustic things that nature bestows. As well as cherish the diligence and sophistication from the skillful hands of ceramic village artisans. Vietclay is the place where Vietnamese people exchange and immerse themselves with Vietnamese works. The most wonderful thing is to admire the simple yet artistic ceramic works. Where Vietclay can pour out their heart, share: joy or deep sadness. With the desire to spread warmth, positive energy. Vietclay hopes to be able to arouse inspiration in each person to make life more poetic and meaningful.
